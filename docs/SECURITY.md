# Security Guidelines

## Overview
CounterIntelApp is designed with a military-grade security framework, adhering to DARPA and defense standards. The platform implements best practices for secure communication, data protection, and compliance.

## Key Features
1. **Zero Trust Architecture**:
   - Employs Cloudflare Zero Trust for identity and device verification.
   - Enforces strict access controls and endpoint monitoring.

2. **Quantum-Safe Encryption**:
   - Utilizes Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange.
   - Implements Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber).

3. **Secure Data Transport**:
   - gRPC with Protobuf for low-latency, secure communication.
   - HTTP/3 (Quiche) for encrypted, high-speed data transport.

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - Immutable storage using immudb and IPFS for archival.
   - End-to-end encryption for all data at rest and in transit.

## Compliance
- ISO 27001/27701 certified for information security and privacy management.
- CMMC Level 3+ compliance for defense readiness.
- Fully adheres to GDPR and other global data protection regulations.

## Security Best Practices
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
- Regularly audit user access and system logs.
- Update dependencies and monitor vulnerabilities using Dependabot and other tools.
