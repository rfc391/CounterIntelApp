## Overview
CounterIntelApp is a military-grade, DARPA-aligned application designed for secure operational coordination, advanced signal processing, and real-time intelligence. This platform leverages cutting-edge technologies in AI, cryptography, and decentralized systems to ensure seamless and secure communication.

## Key Features
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Powered by Kafka and RabbitMQ for scalable data processing.
- **AI & ML**: Integrates OpenCV, ONNX, and NVIDIA Triton for advanced analytics and intelligence.
- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes gRPC with Protobuf and Quiche/HTTP3 for low-latency, secure data transport.
- **Data Storage**:
  - Time-Series Database: InfluxDB.
  - Immutable Storage: immudb with IPFS for archival.
  - Transactional Database: Cloudflare D1/PostgreSQL.
- **Quantum-Safe Security**: Employs QKD and PQC encryption standards for future-proof data protection.
- **Performance Optimization**: Includes Redis caching and Cloudflare Workers for high-speed edge computation.
- **Compliance Standards**: Fully compliant with ISO 27001/27701, GDPR, and CMMC Level 3+.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, gRPC, and RabbitMQ.
- **Frontend**: React.js with modern UI/UX principles.
- **Containerization**: Docker and Kubernetes for scalable deployments.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki for real-time insights.
